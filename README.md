# Chat 🔐 Logger
Telegram private chat logger (using telegram business chatbots API) on cloudflare workers.

<br>

### 💭 **Why?**
- Prevent data loss when users delete the chat for both sides.
- Maintain an organized and searchable record of all conversations.

<br>

## 🗂 Variables
```javascript
const BOT_TOKEN = "BOT_TOKEN"; // Insert your bot token.
const BOT_WEBHOOK = "/endpoint"; // Let it be as it is.
const BOT_SECRET = "BOT_SECRET"; // Insert a powerful secret text (only [A-Z, a-z, 0-9, _, -] are allowed).
const BOT_OWNER = 123456789; // Insert your telegram account id.
```

### Setup:
- Get `BOT_TOKEN` from [@botfather](https://t.me/botfather).
  - Enable business mode from botfather `bot settings > business mode`.
  - Add your bot as third-party chatbot in your telegram account `settings > telegram business > chatbots`.
- Change `BOT_WEBHOOK` with your preferred webhook.
- Change `BOT_SECRET` with a powerful secret text (only `[A-Z, a-z, 0-9, _, -]` are allowed).
- Get `BOT_OWNER` from [@idbot](https://t.me/username_to_id_bot).

<br>
